# Color-Detection
The above is a code which identifies major colors present in the image though object detection using YOLO and subsequently K-Means clustering. Please download the "-.weights file for YOLO v3 model from the darknet website and place it in the model directory. Also configure the yolov3_model.py and run accordingly to be able to read the "-.weights file" and to produce "model.h5" file. Run "colour_predictor.py" to identify the major colors in the detected objects.
